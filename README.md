# Optical-Character-Recognition-OCR-of-handwritten-digits
This project demonstrates a simple yet effective approach using OpenCV and the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm to recognize digits from a sample image containing 5000 handwritten digit examples. The goal is to classify each digit correctly and evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy.
